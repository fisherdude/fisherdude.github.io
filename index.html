  <h2>Info about Michael Johnson</h2>

    <p>I am Michael Johnson, and my pronouns are he/him/his. I am a student in the Mechanical Engineering program at UW-Madison. It is currently my second year but who knows how long it could take.</p>

    <p>I was born and raised in Madison, WI attending Frank Allis Elementary, Sennett Middle, and La Follette High school. I spend most of my time here in Madison but I like to get out to my home away from home in Presque Isle, WI whenever I can.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Fishing and/or just being out on the water</li>

        <li>Anything tech-y eg. Building pc's, Video games, etc.</li>
      </ul>
